Infrastructure feature:

1) Implement IoC configuration file parsing and building module (for example xml configuration files). (+)
2) Implement Proxy configurations via some file types. (+)
3) Implement cleanup thread, that will track objects which have been accessed more than 15 min (-)
4) For IoC infrastructure implement AssemblyResolver mechanism (-)

GC improvements:

5) Consider replacing object references with integer handles in Dictionary objects (for example Type instance replace with int -> Type.GetHashCode()) (+)
/* A single array of 100,000 object references is also more expensive, because although the array itself is only a single object, 
now the garbage collector must also scan the contents of the array to see if any of the objects inside it need to be kept alive */
